# Global AI Bootcamp 2023

Join us for an inspiring evening focusing on how you can implement AI solutions using pre-trained AI services like Cognitive Services and Bot Framework, or by building your own machine learning models with Azure ML and open-source frameworks like PyTorch. By the end of the day, you will be able to infuse AI into your applications.

## Workshops description

### Workshop 1 - Introduction to Azure ML Responsible AI

A machine learning model is a black box that is difficult to debug. Traditional machine learning model performance techniques provide a little view of the true model accuracy. In addition, these techniques have a blind spot in finding where the model or data errors are. This can lead to fairness or societal bias issues. There is an increasing need for transparency to be able to understand or explain what features drove a model’s outcome for some industry regulations. This workshop will give you hands-on learning on how to use Azure Machine Learning’s Responsible AI dashboard to debug a model using Error Analysis, Data Analysis and Explainability/Interpretability. At the end of the workshop, you will learn best practices of using Azure Responsible AI dashboard to help ML professionals produce AI solutions that are less harmful and more trustworthy.

### Workshop 3 - Patient registration made easy with AI services

Most of the forms we complete nowadays are online but there are still times when we need to complete paper-based forms. There are plenty of examples, for this workshop, we've chosen a patient registration for a doctor's surgery.
